Imposition of this balance may not be obvious when free disposal is allowed and stated supply is defined as capacity level, so that-if some fraction of capacity is unused-actual supply equals demand below stated supply. In particular, many studies of micro-founded models with goods exchange define an equilibrium as quantities and prices exhibiting supply equal to demand and satisfying the agents' optimization problems or derived necessary conditions for solutions to these problems"},{"term":"Ex ante","description":"Situation of planned outcomes when actions are taken"},{"term":"Ex post","description":"Situation of actual outcomes"},{"term":"Expectation","description":"Estimate of an economic factor's future value in an economic model. The first moment in a probabilistic model. Different types of expectation formation in an economic model are: rational (expected value at a future date and contingency in the form of an event in a set of values for each future date and event will prevail at the respective future date and event), static or myopic (same value expected to prevail at all future dates and events). Perfect foresight regards the knowledge of a future value when there are no contingencies, that is, rational expectation under certainty. Static expectations may be based on currently or previously realized values. Individuals may form an expectation about an endogenous economic factor (determined inside the economic model) such as a demand or an exogenous economic factor (determined outside the economic model) such as a parameter"},{"term":"Forecast","description":"Estimate or prediction of coming events or conditions, which are endogenous to the economic model (determined inside the economic model)"},{"term":"General equilibrium","description":"Equality of supply and demand holds for all of an economy's goods.
